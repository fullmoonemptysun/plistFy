## App Overview

### Description 

**An app that allows users to compare their spotify playlists to others and add the songs they are missing.**

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

**Category:** Entertainment

**Mobile:** High – Offers a smoother, more intuitive experience for playlist management on mobile, with gestures and drag-and-drop interfaces not present in Spotify’s native app.

**Story:** Strong – Users often want more control over playlists than Spotify’s mobile app allows. This tool makes playlist curation easier and more enjoyable, especially for power users.

**Market:** Medium to High – Spotify has hundreds of millions of users; this app targets the segment that actively curates playlists and music libraries.

**Habit:** Medium – Users may not open it daily, but music lovers would use it regularly when organizing or discovering music.

**Scope:** Medium – Relies on the Spotify Web API for playlist access and modification. No backend needed initially.
