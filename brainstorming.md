**Spotify Playlist Editor**
===
**Description:** An app that allows users to compare their spotify playlists to others and add the songs they are missing.

**Category:** Entertainment

**Mobile:** High – Offers a smoother, more intuitive experience for playlist management on mobile, with gestures and drag-and-drop interfaces not present in Spotify’s native app.

**Story:** Strong – Users often want more control over playlists than Spotify’s mobile app allows. This tool makes playlist curation easier and more enjoyable, especially for power users.

**Market:** Medium to High – Spotify has hundreds of millions of users; this app targets the segment that actively curates playlists and music libraries.

**Habit:** Medium – Users may not open it daily, but music lovers would use it regularly when organizing or discovering music.

**Scope:** Medium – Relies on the Spotify Web API for playlist access and modification. No backend needed initially.

**Expense tracker**
===
**Description:** An app that allows users to easily log, categorize, and visualize their daily expenses. Offers smart features like recurring expense detection, budget alerts, and minimalist input methods. Focuses on speed, clarity, and long-term habit-building without bloat.

**Category:** Finance / Productivity

**Mobile:** High – Designed for quick, frictionless entry on the go with one-tap logging, voice input, and intuitive UI that beats most bank and finance apps in speed and clarity.

**Story:** Strong – Many users try budgeting apps but give up due to complexity or clutter. This tool focuses on minimal, consistent usage, helping users build better financial awareness over time.

**Market:** High – Budgeting and expense tracking are near-universal needs. The app targets students, freelancers, travelers, and professionals seeking personal finance clarity.

**Habit:** Medium to High – Users are encouraged to log purchases daily or weekly. Push reminders and streaks can reinforce the habit, especially around payday or end-of-month reviews.

**Scope:** Medium – Can begin as a standalone mobile app with local storage or simple cloud sync. Later features like data analytics, bank integration (via Plaid or Salt Edge), or shared budgets may increase complexity.
